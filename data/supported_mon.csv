0109;Koffing;Poison Gas Pokemon;Toxic gas is held within its thin, balloon-shaped body, so it can cause massive explosions. The poisonous gases it contains are a little bit lighter than air. That’s why it’s always slightly airborne.
0110;Weezing;Poison Gas Pokemon;When it inhales poisonous gases from garbage, its body expands, and its insides smell much worse. Top-grade perfume is made using its internal poison gases by diluting them to the highest level.
0110;Galarian Weezing;Poison Gas Pokemon;This Pokémon consumes particles that contaminate the air. Instead of leaving droppings, it expels clean air. Long ago, during a time when droves of factories fouled the air with pollution, Weezing changed into this form for some reason.
0111;Rhyhorn;Spikes Pokemon;Rhyhorn claims an area with over a six mile radius as its territory. It apparently forgets where this territory is when running, however. Once it starts running, it won’t stop—even if it crashes through boulders. This disposition is what’s caused its habitat to expand.
0112;Rhydon;Drill Pokemon;It evolved to walk using only its hind legs, which has allowed it to expand its habitat even onto steep mountains. The horn of a Rhydon is powerful enough to crush raw diamonds. These Pokémon polish their horns by bashing them together.
0113;Chansey;Egg Pokemon;This kindly Pokémon lays highly nutritious eggs and shares them with injured Pokémon or people. It walks carefully to prevent its egg from breaking. However, it is extremely fast at running away.

0115;Kangaskhan;Parent Pokemon;Although it’s carrying its baby in a pouch on its belly, Kangaskhan is swift on its feet. It intimidates its opponents with quick jabs. There are records of a lost human child being raised by a childless Kangaskhan.

0120;Staryu;Star Shape Pokemon;Fish Pokémon nibble at it, but Staryu isn’t bothered. Its body regenerates quickly, even if part of it is completely torn off. If you visit a beach at the end of summer, you’ll be able to see groups of Staryu lighting up in a steady rhythm.

0123;Scyther;Mantis Pokemon;It slashes through grass with its sharp scythes, moving too fast for the human eye to track. The sharp scythes on its forearms become increasingly sharp by cutting through hard objects.
0124;Jynx;Human Shape Pokemon;The Jynx of Galar often have beautiful and delicate voices. Some of these Pokémon have even gathered a fan base. In certain parts of Galar, Jynx was once feared and worshiped as the Queen of Ice.

0127;Pinsir;Stag Beetle Pokemon;These Pokémon judge one another based on pincers. Thicker, more impressive pincers make for more popularity with the opposite gender. This Pokémon clamps its pincers down on its prey and then either splits the prey in half or flings it away.

0128;Paldean Tauros (Aqua Breed);Wild Bull Pokemon;It swims by jetting water from its horns. The most notable characteristic of the Aqua Breed is its high body fat, which allows it to float easily. This Pokémon blasts water from holes on the tips of its horns—the high-pressure jets pierce right through Tauros’s enemies.
0129;Magikarp;Fish Pokemon;An underpowered, pathetic Pokémon. It may jump high on rare occasions but never more than seven feet. In the distant past, it was somewhat stronger than the horribly weak descendants that exist today.

0138;Omanyte;Spiral Pokemon;This Pokémon is a member of an ancient, extinct species. Omanyte paddles through water with its 10 tentacles, looking like it’s just drifting along. Because some Omanyte manage to escape after being restored or are released into the wild by people, this species is becoming a problem.
0139;Omastar;Spiral Pokemon;Omastar’s sharp fangs could crush rock, but the Pokémon can attack only the prey that come within reach of its tentacles. Weighed down by a large and heavy shell, Omastar couldn’t move very fast. Some say it went extinct because it was unable to catch food.
